## Maps
**DISCLAIMER:** During the creation of the campaign maps, I changed techniques several times (due to my lack of experience in foundry and map making). This means that some maps feature heavy use of tiles inside foundry while others use a flat background image on which key tiles are placed. I.e. some maps won't be useful outside of FoundryVTT. See below for details.

### Opening Scene
The opening scene in the ravine with Wetherman and goblins waiting to ambush the players. This map is made completely inside foundry using tiles and is thus only usable in FoundryVTT.

### Riddermound
The Riddermound adventure, with Grub in hiding, the magical torches and several point of interests like the statues. This map doesn't use tiles to recreate the map. Instead, the official map from the book is used and FoundryVTT constructs are overlayed onto the map (such as walls, doors, lightning, etc.)

### Bothhild's Lode
Four maps (rewamp 2023-06-31)
* Outside Bothild's Lode (approaching the mine)
* Inside the first part of the mine (with goblins and wolfs)
* The Garrison
* Flooded mines

The maps primarily use the official Dragonebane map as a drawing template and adds tiles onto the map. Players should see only original tiles when playing. Out of the box, these maps only work in FoundryVTT.

Completely new versions of all the maps as of 2023-06-31. The maps use a static background image using forgotten adventures free tiles and. FoundryVTT assets such as walls, lighting, sounds and tokens are added on top. The base maps should be usable outside of foundry. The mines are not exactly a 1:1 represenation of the campaign maps since the forgotten adventures cave tiles are a bit too incompatible in terms of size. But the basic structure of the mine is the same.

### Temple of the Purple Flame
Contains three maps, the temple and its basement as well as a representation of the demon realm. These maps again use the FoundryVTT tiling system so probably only usable inside FoundryVTT.

### Tower of Sighs
Contains 5 maps:
* The swamp surrounding the tower
* The ground level of the tower
* Level 2 and 3 of the tower
* The tower roof
* The underground temple

These scenes uses a base background image with FoundryVTT tiles and icons overlayed ontop of it. The background could be used outside of FoundryVTT.

### The Oracle Cave
A large map encompassing the outside, the cave and the keep. Tiles placed as overlays in FoundryVTT including cobwebs, stones, corpses etc. Includes NPC enemy spiders and the eel beast.

The background image should be usable in other systems.

### Troll's Spire
Three levels of the spire + roof and the crypt.

These maps use little to no tiles inside the FoundryVTT engine and should thus be completely usable outside of FoundryVTT.

### Dead Eyes Cave
Large map with the dead eyes cave system.

The map uses a background image + some tiles within FoundryVTT.

### Generic Battlemaps
I've included 9 generic battlemaps from [Forgotten Adventures](https://www.forgotten-adventures.net/battlemaps/) for random encounters

![](screenshots/battlemaps.png)

### Omens
One "atmosphere" image for each of the demonic omens
![](screenshots/omens.png)

### Random Encounters
Ten "atmosphere" images for what I consider important encounters, including the map of the misty vale (with correct grid scale so the FoundryVTT measuring tool can be used).

### Outskirts Atmosphere
Nine scenes to represent various locations in outskirt including the crypt of um-durman, battlemap for the inn and the town.
